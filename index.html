My name is Toby Chen and I was born in San Diego 
California. My mom is from Hong Kong and my dad is 
from Taiwan. <span class = "highlight">I can speak 3 languages and have a dog 
named Biscuit.</span> I like to travel and my favorite place 
to go is Taiwan. I would like to go to <a href = "https:
//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target = "_blank">Europe</a>
one day and see all the various landmarks and monuments 
there. My favorite subjects include math, computer 
science, and physics because I love to solve challenging problems
and work out my brain.

<h3> Hobbies and Interests </h3>

I like to engage my mind and body a lot so most of my 
hobbies include solving problems or exercising. 
One of my hobbies is playing <a href = "https://chess.com" target = "_blank">Chess</a> as it fosters my
 strategic thoughts and keeps me on my toes. 
 I also love swimming for the physical workout and 
 relaxing in the water. Hiking is an adventurous 
 outing I use to reset my energy by connecting with 
 nature and diverting my attention from stressors. 
 Lastly, I’m a big eater and I love trying new foods, 
 especially Asian cuisine.

<h3>My Personality </h3>

<p>

I’m a naturally curious person who loves learning new 
things and exploring different ideas whenever I can. 
Meeting new people is something I really enjoy, and I’m
 always excited to make new friends. At the same time, 
 Im also very competitive, so I will try my best to be 
 the best at everything, especially when competing against
  others. Some competitions I do are Chess and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Invitational_Mathematics_Examination" target = "_blank">Math competitions</a>.
  I also like finding creative ways to solve 
  problems, which makes even ordinary tasks feel more 
  interesting. Overall, I’d say I’m someone who’s curious,
   determined, and always looking to make the most out of 
   everything
